# Navigation Messages and Server - sample Control Panel GUI

Control Panel for the [navigation_server](https://github.com/Sterwen-Technology/navigation_server)

This is sample application written in Python and using the Guizero framework based on Tkinter that interacts with the Console interface of the message_server applications and the local_agent.
It is fully portable and runs on Windows and Linux systems.

## Getting started

This sample application works in conjunction with the message server. So the first step is to have an up and running server.



## Description

## Visuals

## Installation

best option is to install the application from github and clone it locally.

## Usage

simply run the main python module from the 'src' directory: `python nav_msg_svr_guiy.py -a <IP address/hotname of server> -p <port number>`


## Support

Any additional features is welcome. Development on new architecture and frameworks is even more useful.

## Roadmap
